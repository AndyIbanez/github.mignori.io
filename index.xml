      <description>Welcome to the new Mignori website!
We have been hard at work at working in our apps and our websites, and this website is one of those.
We know you think this website looks worse than the other one. And aesthetically speaking, you may be right! But we chose to Migrate to this website for a few reasons:
 It&amp;rsquo;s not Wordpress. We have more control over the themes. It&amp;rsquo;s built using Hugo.</description>

      <description>Our Privacy Policy is very simple, and we have no interest on walking around with a lot of jargon that nobody will bother to read. Instead, we will simply tell you what Mignori as itself does, and what it does not do.
HTTP Calls to Third-Party Servers Please note that the primary purpose of Mignori is to be a Browser for Imageboards running a certain software. As such, you should take all the precautions you would take when using a standard web browser and understand the implications of their usage.</description>

      <description>If you would like to use, test, and help improve Mignori before it hits the App Store, feel free to join the Beta program. The Beta program is open to anyone, runs on TestFlight, and it’s open to the public. If you are interested, sign up now, because we have limited slots for beta testers and the program will close once we reach our quota.
There’s a few rules you must follow to join this program.</description>

      <description>Mignori is a Booru Image Board browser for iOS. It features many features from basic search all the way to app style customization.
&amp;nbsp; Search The most basic feature you can expect from a Booru website. In Mignori, you can search using the familiar tag system you already know, and Mignori supports the tag systems for different Boorus. For most Boorus, multi-word tags are separated with an underscore (such as card_captor_sakura), but it can also search in systems were tags are separated with commas.</description>
