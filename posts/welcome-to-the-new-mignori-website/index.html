                <p>Welcome to the new Mignori website!</p>
<p>We have been hard at work at working in our apps and our websites, and this website is one of those.</p>
<p>We know you think this website looks worse than the other one. And aesthetically speaking, you may be right! But we chose to Migrate to this website for a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s not Wordpress.</li>
<li>We have more control over the themes.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s built using <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a>.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s much faster, lighter, and responsive than the other one. Specially friendly for mobile devices that don&rsquo;t have unlimited data and tiny screens.</li>
<li>It still gets the job done!</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, a very important feature:</p>
<p>It shows you that we are still working in the app! Since we bothered to upgrade our website, it could just mean we have bigger plans in the works, right?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Mignori 3.0 will adopt a bunch of iOS 13 features and there&rsquo;s big plans for the future. I wish I could tell you more, but I have to keep my mouth shut for now. In the meantime, monitor this website for updates on development of the app, and join the Beta while slots are still available.</p>
